# This file is a Bundler dependency descriptor file. Its purpose is to list all of
# the dependencies you are using to build your site. It is highly recommended you use 
# this to keep your dependencies up to date and not cause conflicts with other gems
# already on your system. 
#
# If you do not already have Bundler installed on your computer, run:
#
#  gem install bundler
#
# To use this dependecy file simply run:
# 
#  bundle install
#
# We do recommend that you install the gems into another directory however, to ensure
# your awestruct site is pristine and isn't using versions of gems from other programs.
# To do this execute:
# 
#  bundle install --path .bundle
#
# More information about Bundler and its other commands can be found at http://gembundler.com/.
# To add other dependencies for your awestruct site simply follow the same pattern as you'll
# find below. To make use of dependecies listed here, simply remove the '#' from the start of
# the line to uncomment the dependency. We hope you enjoy using Awestruct!
