    %h3 Goal
    %p The goal of Awestruct is to make it trivially easy to bake out non-trivial static websites. In addition to providing template-driven site creation (using Haml), Awestruct provides facilities for easily priming the site creation with additional non-page data.

    %h3 Concept
    %p The core concept of Awestruct is that of structures, specifically Ruby OpenStruct structures. The struct aspect allows arbitrary, schema-less data to be associated with a specific page or the entire site.
